## âš  A MASSIVE REWRITE IS TAKING PLACE IN THE [smelte-ts branch](https://github.com/LiveTL/HyperChat/tree/smelte-ts)!

## Building from Source
Clone the repository recursively:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiveTL/HyperChat --recursive
```
Open the repository and npm install:
```bash
cd hyperchat
npm install
```
Build or serve the extension:
```bash
npm run serve # hot reload mode
npm run build # production mode
```

## Additional Info
* The extension may *eventually* be rewritten in Svelte. However, we have not started the process in the interest of time. If you would like to contribute to porting the components to Svelte, please check out the `svelte` branch.
